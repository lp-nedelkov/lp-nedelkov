I'm a detail-oriented and analytical Software Engineer with a passion for programming. My past projects have exposed me to a diverse set of technologies, including: Java 8, Maven, Jenkins, Nexus, Oracle SQL, Git, Log4j, Junit, Mockito, Linux, Bash scripting, Atlassian apps(Jira, Bitbucket, Confluence). 
Furthermore during my recent career break I have completed several courses covering topics and features in Spring Boot 3, Spring Data JPA, Spring Framework 6, JavaScript, React, Node.js(as a build tool), Bootstrap, JWT, TLS, AWS Services (EC2, ELB, ElasticBeanstalk, RDS, S3, CloudFront).
I then proceeded to collect user-requirements, design, build, test, release and deploy a simple booking application for a small business using a full-stack approach to AWS, for which I will be happy to share further details. 

I'm looking to collaborate on any interesting projects utilizing the mentioned technologies.

I'm reachable at lyubomir.nedelkov@gmail.com
