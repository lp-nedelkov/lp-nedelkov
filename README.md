I'm a detail-oriented and analytical thinker with a passion for
programming, who has spent the last several months brushing up on
his core Java, Algorithms and Data structures, SQL and overall coding
skills. Furthermore, I have been exploring technologies such as
Maven, SpringBoot and ORM via Spring Data JPA by developing some
simple REST APIs. I have also familiarised myself with version control
systems such as Git.
I’m currently learning React, JQuery and JavaScript for frond-end development

I'm looking to collaborate on any interesting projects utilizing the mentioned technologies
I'm reachable at lyubomir.nedelkov@gmail.com
